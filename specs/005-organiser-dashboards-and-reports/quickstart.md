# Quickstart: Organiser Dashboards and Reports

This guide provides a quick overview for organisers on how to access and utilize the dashboards and reports for their camps.

## 1. Accessing the Admin Dashboard

Access to the organiser dashboard is managed via secure magic links.

1.  **Receive Magic Link**: An administrator will send a magic link to your registered organiser email address.
2.  **Login**: Click on the magic link in your email. This will securely log you into the admin dashboard without requiring a password.
3.  **Navigate**: Once logged in, you will be directed to the main admin dashboard, typically located at `/admin`.

## 2. Viewing Camp Summary

The Camp Summary Dashboard provides a high-level overview of a selected camp's registration progress.

1.  **Select a Camp**: From the main admin dashboard, choose the camp you wish to view from the list of available camps.
2.  **View Summary**: The Camp Dashboard page will load, displaying:
    *   Total number of purchases.
    *   Number of completed registrations.
    *   Number of missing registrations.

## 3. Viewing Daily Attendance

The Daily Attendance View allows you to see which players are scheduled for a specific day.

1.  **Navigate to Attendance**: From the Camp Dashboard, click on the "View Attendance" link.
2.  **Select a Date**: On the Attendance List page, select the desired date using the provided date picker.
3.  **Review Attendance**: The list will update to show all players registered for that day, including their name, age group, and key medical information.

## 4. Viewing Kit Order Summary

The Kit Order Summary helps you manage bulk orders for camp merchandise.

1.  **Navigate to Kit Orders**: From the Camp Dashboard, find and click on the "Kit Orders" link.
2.  **Review Summary**: The page will display a summary table showing each item type/size (e.g., 'Jersey - L') and the total quantity required across all registrations for the selected camp.

## 5. Viewing Missing Registrations

Identify and follow up with guardians who have not yet completed their player registrations.

1.  **Navigate to Missing Registrations**: From the Camp Dashboard, click on the "Missing Registrations" link.
2.  **Review List**: The page will display a list of all purchases where the player registration process is not yet complete. This includes the guardian's name and email for easy follow-up.

## 6. Exporting Data to CSV

All primary data views (Attendance, Kit Orders, Missing Registrations) offer CSV export functionality.

1.  **Access an Exportable View**: Navigate to the Daily Attendance, Kit Order Summary, or Missing Registrations page.
2.  **Click Export**: Look for an "Export to CSV" button (or similar) on the page.
3.  **Download**: Clicking the button will download a CSV file containing the data currently displayed on the screen, which can be opened with standard spreadsheet software.

**Note**: For attendance exports, ensure the correct date is selected before exporting.
